This is my personal website.

# Goals
This is my online repository.  `cyinwei.me` is where any entity (human or
computer) can come and **fetch data** about me.  

It's not really a place for any entity to give me feedback?? (Asynchronous feedback
  is too AI heavy?).  Maybe in the next version.

## Audience
Different entities want different things from me.

0. Myself
1. Entities who care about **me**
2. Entities who care about **my work**.
3. First contact point.

Does my website deal with each entity?  Yeah.

### Myself
I use my site for two things: a dashboard and a time capsule.

####Dashboard + Analytics
I basically want a quest tab for my life.  Like here are my goals, and here are
the metrics for that.  

####Time Capsule
I want to look back on my life.  It could be notes... like how did I learn how to
do A-Priori on a basket-market data?  It could be a timeline.  It could be how I
think on certain circumstances (life, people).

###People who care about me
There are entities (family, crawlers) that want to know what I've been up to.

###People who care about what I do
There are entities that want to know about the work I produce.  Could be for
a job.  Could be people who want to learn.

###First contact point
If I'm a product, then this is my landing page.
